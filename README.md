## Hawkeye - AI Agent for Market Intelligence
<br>
HawkEye is an intelligent surveillance platform that deploys multiple AI agents to track trades, filings, and news in real time. Each agent specializes in tasks like entity linking, anomaly detection, and signal scoringâ€”working together to surface relationships between investors, companies, and events. Built for compliance teams, researchers, and regulators, HawkEye transforms fragmented market data into explainable, real-time insight.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
